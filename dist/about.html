                        <p>In addition, VA is specifically recognized in the AI Bill of Rights Fact Sheet as embodying the guidelines of the document by specifically protecting our Veterans and supporting their health care. This acknowledgment is attributed to various VA pilot programs that will provide Veterans with information about any AI system used in their health care and ensure AI risks are managed during human subjects research.</p>
